```

The project will be organized into the following directories:

- `infrastructure`: This directory will contain the Terraform configuration files for provisioning the necessary infrastructure resources on AWS, including VPCs, subnets, security groups, and EKS cluster.
- `deployment`: This directory will contain the GitHub Actions workflow files for setting up a deployment pipeline to build and deploy the Socks Shop application to the Kubernetes cluster.
- `monitoring`: This directory will contain the configuration files for setting up Prometheus to monitor the performance and health of the Socks Shop application.
- `logging`: This directory will contain the configuration files for setting up a centralized logging solution, such as ELK stack, to collect and analyze logs from the Socks Shop application.
- `security`: This directory will contain the Ansible playbooks for securing the infrastructure with network perimeter security access rules and encrypting sensitive information using Ansible Vault.

The project will also include a `README.md` file in each directory to provide detailed instructions on how to set up and configure the components.

## **Prerequisites:**

The following tools and technologies will be used in the project:

- Terraform: Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. It codifies APIs into declarative configuration files, creating infrastructure as code using a high-level configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).

- AWS Account: An AWS account will be required to provision the necessary infrastructure resources, such as VPCs, subnets, security groups, and EKS cluster.

- GitHub Actions: GitHub Actions will be used to set up a deployment pipeline to build and deploy the Socks Shop application to the Kubernetes cluster.

- Kubernetes: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

- Helm: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that provides an easy way to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes.

- Prometheus: Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed to be true.

- ELK Stack: The ELK Stack is a collection of three open-source products — Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana — all developed, managed, and maintained by Elastic. The ELK Stack is used to collect, search, analyze, and visualize log data in real time.

- Ansible: Ansible is an open-source automation tool that automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment.

- Let's Encrypt: Let's Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority brought to you by the nonprofit Internet Security Research Group (ISRG).

- Docker: Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

- Socks Shop Application: The Socks Shop application is a popular microservices-based e-commerce platform that is used as a reference application for demonstrating modern cloud-native technologies.

## **Project Overview:**

The Socks Shop application is a popular microservices-based e-commerce platform that is used as a reference application for demonstrating modern cloud-native technologies. The application is composed of multiple microservices, each of which is responsible for a specific function, such as product catalog, shopping cart, and user authentication. The application is designed to be highly scalable, resilient, and fault-tolerant, making it an ideal candidate for deployment on Kubernetes.

The project will involve deploying the Socks Shop application on a Kubernetes cluster using an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach. This will include provisioning the necessary infrastructure resources on AWS, setting up a deployment pipeline, monitoring the performance and health of the application, and securing the infrastructure.

The project will be implemented using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, GitHub Actions for the deployment pipeline, Kubernetes for container orchestration, Helm for package management, Prometheus for monitoring, ELK Stack for logging, and Ansible for security.

## **Project Objectives:**

The main objectives of the project are as follows:

- Deploy the Socks Shop application on a Kubernetes cluster using an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach
- Provision the necessary infrastructure resources on AWS, including VPCs, subnets, security groups, and EKS cluster
- Set up a deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions to build and deploy the Socks Shop application to the Kubernetes cluster
- Monitor the performance and health of the Socks Shop application using Prometheus
- Collect and analyze logs from the Socks Shop application using a centralized logging solution, such as ELK stack
- Secure the infrastructure with network perimeter security access rules and encrypt sensitive information using Ansible Vault.

## Infrastructure Provisioning

Using Terraform, we will provision the necessary infrastructure resources on AWS, including VPCs, subnets, security groups, and EKS cluster. This will allow for a clear and reproducible infrastructure setup.

## Deployment Pipeline

The project will include a deployment pipeline that utilizes GitHub Actions to build and deploy the Socks Shop application to the Kubernetes cluster. This will enable fast and reliable deployments, with the ability to easily rollback changes if necessary.

## Monitoring

Prometheus will be used to monitor the performance and health of the Socks Shop application. This will include metrics such as request latency, error rate, and request volume.
Logging: The project will include a centralized logging solution, such as ELK stack, to collect and analyze logs from the Socks Shop application. This will enable quick identification and resolution of issues.

## Logging

The project will include a centralized logging solution, such as ELK stack, to collect and analyze logs from the Socks Shop application. This will enable quick identification and resolution of issues.

## Security

The application will be secured with HTTPS using a Let's Encrypt certificate. Additionally, bonus points will be awarded for securing the infrastructure with network perimeter security access rules and encrypting sensitive information using Ansible Vault.

## **Conclusion:**

This project will provide hands-on experience with Infrastructure as Code, Kubernetes, DevOps best practices, and cloud security. It will also demonstrate the value of automation and monitoring in ensuring the reliability and performance of microservices-based applications. The project will be a valuable addition to the team's portfolio and will help to build a strong foundation in modern cloud-native technologies.
