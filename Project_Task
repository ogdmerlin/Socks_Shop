Overview:

A microservices-based architecture application is deployed on Kubernetes and there’s a need to create a clear IaaC (Infrastructure as Code) deployment to be able to deploy the services in a fast manner.

Setup Details:

Provision the Socks Shop example microservice application – https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo.github.io

Task Instructions:

● Everything needs to be deployed using an Infrastructure as Code approach.

● In your solution please emphasize readability, maintainability, and DevOps

● We expect a clear way to recreate your setup and will evaluate the project decisions based on:

– Deploy pipeline
– Metrics
– Monitoring
– Logging

● Use Prometheus as a monitoring tool

● Use ansible or Terraform as the configuration management tool.

● You can use an IaaS provider of your choice.

● The application should run on Kubernetes

Extra Project Requirements:

● The application should run on HTTPS with a Let’s Encrypt certificate

● Bonus points for securing the infrastructure with network perimeter security access rules

● Bonus points if you use ansible Vault for encrypting sensitive information.
